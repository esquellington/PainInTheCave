* Design

So what tech is more ancient than "rendering" on cave walls? None, I bet!

The tribe is diminishing, only a Hunter, a Gatherer and a Scout
remain. To survive, they must feed the fire with wood to remain warm and
safe, hunt and gather themselves a healthy dose of prehistoric
proteins and carbohidrates and avoid being eaten by wolves, ran down
by bisons and annoyed by birds that steal their crops...

Controls:
- Click on tribemen to selec them, and click on a target resource to
collect it (Hunter->Meat, Gatherer->Cereal, Scout->Wood), on an animal
to attack it (Hunter), or anywhere to move (All).
- Actions cannot be interrupted, so use your 21st century brain to
plan ahead your actions in the -100th


* Gameplay
** Resources:
   - Fire
     - Scout torch
   - Food
** Characters
   - Hunter (lance/bow)
     - Provides
       - 1x Food
       - Protection
     - Requires:
       - 2x Food
   - Gatherer (schythe)
     - Provides: 2x Food
     - Req: Protection, 1x Food
   - Scout (torch)
     - Provides:
       - Fire
       - Protection in radius if torch lit
     - Requires: 1x Food
** Mechanics
   - Extintion or Survival
   - Balance food so that all chars are required for survival
   - Fire protects all in radius, decreasing, consumes
   - Food decreases constantly
** Control
   - Click on character, click on target
     - H: Attack enemy or Gather carcass and go to Food
     - G: Gather, go to Food
     - S: Gather, go to Fire
   - SINGLE action at a time, uncancellable
     - Per-character plan:
       - Go to X
       - Stop at X
       - Gather, if anything suitable
       - Wait for next order
     - Constant movement speed
   - Once a char has an order, he can only fulfill it or die
   - Different char can act in parallel
   - Die if hit by enemy
** Wildlife
   - Appear at random outside safe zone, far from others
   - Wander around for a while, but get hungry
   - Thief: Approach Food, Steal Food, can be scared by any Character
   - Predator: Approach Character, Eat Character, Can only be killed
     by Hunter or scared by Scout
** Gathered Resources
   - Wood
   - Plant
   - Appear at random, far from other
   - Blink on appearance
   - Show +1, +2, whatever on deposit on Food or Fire
** Fire
   - Lit circular area, blink faster when decreasing dangerously
** Food
   - Scale pile to show total, blink if too small
