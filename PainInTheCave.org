* Design

So what tech is more ancient than "rendering" on cave walls? None, I bet!

The tribe is diminishing, only a Hunter, a Gatherer and a Scout
remain. To survive, they must feed the fire with wood to remain warm and
safe, hunt and gather themselves a healthy dose of prehistoric
proteins and carbohidrates and avoid being eaten by wolves, ran down
by bisons and annoyed by birds that steal their crops...

Controls:
- Click on tribemen to selec them, and click on a target resource to
collect it (Hunter->Meat, Gatherer->Cereal, Scout->Wood), on an animal
to attack it (Hunter), or anywhere to move (All).
- Actions cannot be interrupted, so use your 21st century brain to
plan ahead your actions in the -100th


* Gameplay
** Resources:
   - Fire
     - Scout torch
   - Food
** Characters
   - Hunter (lance/bow)
     - Provides
       - 1x Food
       - Protection
     - Requires:
       - 2x Food
   - Gatherer (schythe)
     - Provides: 2x Food
     - Req: Protection, 1x Food
   - Scout (torch)
     - Provides:
       - Fire
       - Protection in radius if torch lit
     - Requires: 1x Food
** Mechanics
   - Extintion or Survival
   - Balance food so that all chars are required for survival
   - Fire protects all in radius, decreasing, consumes
   - Food decreases constantly
** Control
   - Click on character, click on target
     - H: Attack enemy or Gather carcass and go to Food
     - G: Gather, go to Food
     - S: Gather, go to Fire
   - SINGLE action at a time, uncancellable
     - Per-character plan:
       - Go to X
       - Stop at X
       - Gather, if anything suitable
       - Wait for next order
     - Constant movement speed
   - Once a char has an order, he can only fulfill it or die
   - Different char can act in parallel
   - Die if hit by enemy
** Wildlife
   - Appear at random outside safe zone, far from others
   - Wander around for a while, but get hungry
   - Thief: Approach Food, Steal Food, can be scared by any Character
   - Predator: Approach Character, Eat Character, Can only be killed
     by Hunter or scared by Scout
** Gathered Resources
   - Wood
   - Plant
   - Appear at random, far from other
   - Blink on appearance
   - Show +1, +2, whatever on deposit on Food or Fire
** Fire
   - Lit circular area, blink faster when decreasing dangerously
** Food
   - Scale pile to show total, blink if too small

* Postmortem
** Intro

   This was my first Ludum Dare, and just my second Jam altogether. I
   planned to be very realistic with the time limit, avoid overscoping
   and feature creeping... and failed miserably, of course, but had a
   lot of fun and learned a bit in the process.

   The theme was fine, I was initially puzzled and couldn't think of
   anything fun to do with it, but then I wondered what was the most
   "Ancient" invention that could be called "Technology", and the
   cavement setting and cave painting aesthetics followed from there.

** Right

   The cave painting aesthetics is the decision I'm most happy with,
   because they fit the theme pretty well (Ancient Rendering
   Technology?) and were quite easy to draw and animate.

   I'm mainly a C++ programmer, but coded the game in LÖVE
   (https://love2d.org), a Lua-based set of libraries that does just
   the right amount of work for you without forcing any bloated system
   or complex workflow down your throat. I'll definitely use it again
   in future jams.

   As a bonus, Löve2D games can be automatically ported to HTML5 using
   love.js (https://github.com/TannerRogalsky/love.js), which worked
   pretty well despite minor hiccups.

   I did everything on Ubuntu using Free Software, which served me
   perfectly. Inkscape for vector drawing, GIMP for image processing,
   and Emacs for text/code editing.

** Wrong

   I totally overscoped... the game ended up having 3 characters, 3
   enemies and 3 resources, many with totally unique behaviours, as
   well as art. Coding the game mechanics took most of the time I
   spent in the entry.

   As a consequence, the gameplay is quite unbalanced... from control
   response to movement and enemy/resource generation, the game is
   quite punishing. If I were to begin again, I'd remove 1/3 of the
   mechanics and invest in gameplay balancing and global polish.

   On the technical side, LÖVE is great, but dynamic-typed languages
   such as Lua are not my cup of tea, and every time there was an
   error that a static-typed language compiler would have caught I got
   really mad and cursed aloud in the name of Stroustroup... I'll need
   to practice further to follow the way of the type-less programmer.

** Conclusion

   It was a lot of fun, and I'm happy with the result, so overall it
   was a great experience that I'll try to repeat.
